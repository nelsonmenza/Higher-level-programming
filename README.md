# HIGHER-LEVEL-PROGRAMMING

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects showcasing my progress in higher-level programming concepts. The exercises range from basic to intermediate levels and cover various topics in Python programming.

## Directories

- **0x00-Python_hello_world**: This directory includes exercises and projects related to basic Python programming concepts.

- **0x01-Python_if_else_loops_functions**: This directory contains exercises and projects focused on conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python.

- **0x02-Python-import_modules**: This directory contains files in a directory named "modules" to demonstrate how to use modules and create custom ones in Python.

- **0x03-Python_data_structures**: This directory is also in progress and will feature exercises and projects centered around data structures in Python.

- `8-functionChange.py`: Function that changes a character to uppercase. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `9-functionLastDigit.py`: Function to print the last digit of a number. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `10-functionPower.py`: Function to compute 'a' to the power of 'b'. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `11-functionSum.py`: Function to compute the sum of 'a' and 'b'. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `12-FizzBuzz.py`: Function to print numbers from 1 to 100 with replacements for multiples of 3, 5, or both. (#!/usr/bin/python3)

### 0x02-Python_if_else_loops_functions

This directory contains 7 files and 5 more files in a directory named "modules" to demonstrate how to use modules and create custom ones in Python:

- `modules`:Directory with all the modules.

  - `addModule.py`: Module for exercise 0-add.py
  - `calcModule.py`: Module for exercise 1-calc.py
  - `calcProModule.py`: Module for exercise 5-calcPro.py
  - `fileEasyPrint.txt`: File for exercise 6-easyPrint.py
  - `varModule.py`: Module for exercise 4-var.py

- `0-add.py`: Function that sums two number and return the result.(#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `1-calc.py`: Function that sum, sub, mul and div and return the result. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `2-sysArgv.py`: Process the arguments from the command line and print the number of all arguments passed.(#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `3-sumArgv.py`: A script to sum all arguments.
- `4-var.py`: A script that imports a variable from another script and prints its value.(#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `5-calcPro.py`: A simple calculator program that imports a custom module to perform arithmetic operations.(#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `6-easyPrint.py`: This script reads the contents of a file named "fileEasyPrint.txt". It then prints the contents of the file to the console.(#!/usr/bin/python3)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the exercises and projects in each directory. You can navigate to a specific directory and review the individual files to understand the concepts covered.

### Shebang Line

All the Python files in this repository have the `#!/usr/bin/python3` shebang line at the beginning. This line specifies the interpreter to use when running the script, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

### Using Your Own Modules

In some cases, you might find files that import your own modules. These modules are created to demonstrate how you can leverage custom functionality in your programs. You can explore these modules and experiment with them to understand how to use your own modules in your projects.

## Note

The directory "0x03-Python_data_structures" are still in progress, and additional exercises and projects will be added in the near future.

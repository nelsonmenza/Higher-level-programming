# HIGHER-LEVEL-PROGRAMMING

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects showcasing my progress in higher-level programming concepts. The exercises range from basic to intermediate levels and cover various topics in Python programming.

## Directories

- **0x00-Python_hello_world**: This directory includes exercises and projects related to basic Python programming concepts.

- **0x01-Python_if_else_loops_functions**: This directory contains exercises and projects focused on conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python.

- **0x02-Python-import_modules**: This directory is currently in progress and will include exercises and projects related to importing modules in Python.

- **0x03-Python_data_structures**: This directory is also in progress and will feature exercises and projects centered around data structures in Python.

## File Structure

### 0x00-Python_hello_world

This directory includes 8 files that cover various aspects of basic Python programming:

- `0-print.py`: Make a python script that prints special characters. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `1-printInt.py`: Print the integer stored in the variable `number`. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `2-printFloat.py`: Print the float number (pi value) stored in the variable `number`. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `3-printStr.py`: Print the string stored in the variable `str` three times. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `4-strConcat.py`: Concatenate two strings and print the result. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `5-slice.py`: Slice the word "Roadmap" by index. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `6-sliceConcat.py`: Slice and concatenate a string. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `7-zenOfPython.py`: Print the Zen of Python. (#!/usr/bin/python3)

### 0x01-Python_if_else_loops_functions

This directory contains 14 files that focus on more advanced programming concepts in Python:

- `0-positiveNegative.py`: A script to validate if the last digit is negative or positive. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `1-lastDigit.py`: Last Digit Checker. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `2-alphabet.py`: Print the alphabet in lowercase. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `3-alphabetNwLine.py`: Print the alphabet. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `4-numHex.py`: Prints numbers from 0 to 98. The number must be accompanied with its hexadecimal value. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `5-combNumber.py`: Print all possible combinations of numbers from 0 to 99. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
  - `5.1-printNumber.py`: Print all possible combinations of numbers from 0 to 99. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `6-combNumberTwoDigit.py`: Print all possible combinations of numbers between 00 and 99. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `7-functionLowerOrNot.py`: Function to identify if the character is lowercase or not. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `8-functionChange.py`: Function that changes a character to uppercase. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `9-functionLastDigit.py`: Function to print the last digit of a number. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `10-functionPower.py`: Function to compute 'a' to the power of 'b'. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `11-functionSum.py`: Function to compute the sum of 'a' and 'b'. (#!/usr/bin/python3)
- `12-FizzBuzz.py`: Function to print numbers from 1 to 100 with replacements for multiples of 3, 5, or both. (#!/usr/bin/python3)

## Usage

Feel free to explore the exercises and projects in each directory. You can navigate to a specific directory and review the individual files to understand the concepts covered.

### Shebang Line

All the Python files in this repository have the `#!/usr/bin/python3` shebang line at the beginning. This line specifies the interpreter to use when running the script, ensuring compatibility and consistency.

### Using Your Own Modules

In some cases, you might find files that import your own modules. These modules are created to demonstrate how you can leverage custom functionality in your programs. You can explore these modules and experiment with them to understand how to use your own modules in your projects.

## Note

The directories "0x02-Python-import_modules" and "0x03-Python_data_structures" are still in progress, and additional exercises and projects will be added in the near future.
